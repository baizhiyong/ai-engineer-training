    "question": "How did advancements post-2012 and 2017 contribute to the AI boom in the 2020s?",
    "answer": "Advancements after 2012 significantly contributed to the AI boom by enabling the use of graphics processing units to accelerate neural networks, which led to deep learning outperforming earlier AI techniques. This progress laid the foundation for rapid developments in AI capabilities. The momentum further increased after 2017 with the introduction of the transformer architecture, which enhanced the performance of models, particularly in areas like natural language processing. These cumulative advancements set the stage for the period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI observed in the 2020s, marking it as a time of significant growth and innovation in the field.",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom.",

      "arXiv:2208.00733v1  [cs.ET]  1 Aug 2022\nIEEE IOT MAGAZINE, VOL. XX, NO. X, X 2022\n1\nThe Rise of Quantum Internet Computing\nSeng W. Loke, Member, IEEE\nAbstract—This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to distributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet,\nanalogous to (classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over the (classical) Internet. Relevant to\nquantum Internet computing would be areas of study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum information for\ncomputations, quantum cloud computing, delegated veriﬁable blind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\nIndex Terms—quantum Internet computing, quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing, Internet computing, distributed\nsystems, Internet\n”This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Copyright may be transferred without notice, after which this\nversion may no longer be accessible.”\n✦\n1\nINTRODUCTION\nT\nHERE have been tremendous developments in quantum\ncomputing, quantum cryptography, quantum commu-\nnications and the quantum Internet, and we have seen\nincreased investments and intensive research in quantum\ncomputing in recent years [1], [2]. The quantum Internet will\nnot necessarily replace the (classical) Internet we know and\nuse today, at least not in the near future, but can complement\nthe current Internet. The quantum Internet aims to enable\nrobust quantum teleportation (or transmission) of qubits,1\nand entanglement among qubits,2 over long Internet-scale\ndistances, which are key to many of the quantum protocols\nincluding quantum key distribution, quantum voting, and\nothers, as well as for non-local control of quantum gates.\nThere have been efforts to build quantum computers,\nand it remains to see if any one paradigm becomes the\ndominant or best way of building such quantum comput-\ners.",
      "At the same time, even as researchers develop more\npowerful quantum computers (supporting more qubits for\noperations, and at lower error rates), there is an opportunity\nfor connecting multiple quantum computers from differ-\nent sites to achieve much more complex quantum com-\nputations, i.e., inter-linking multiple quantum computers\non different sites to perform distributed computing with\na distributed system of quantum computers (or quantum\nprocessing units (QPUs) at different nodes), arriving at the\nnotion of distributed quantum computing, e.g., [3].\nWhile distributed quantum computing can involve mul-\ntiple QPUs next to each other or at the same site, with the\nquantum Internet, one can envision distributed quantum\n•\nSeng W.

A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information, and can be\nthought of as a two-state, or two-levelled, quantum-mechanical system,\nsuch as an electron’s spi",
      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).",
      "Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\n\nHistory\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academi",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom."

      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.

The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.",

      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).",

    "answer": "量子计算机的核心特征在于其利用量子力学现象进行计算，特别是通过叠加态和纠缠态的特性。其基本信息单位是量子比特（qubit），与经典比特只能处于0或1不同，量子比特可以同时处于多个状态的叠加，测量时以一定概率得到某一结果。通过量子干涉效应，量子计算能够增强期望结果的概率，从而实现高效计算。\n\n相较于经典计算机，量子计算机的优势体现在某些特定问题上可实现指数级加速。例如，它有望破解当前广泛使用的公钥加密体系，并在物理模拟等领域提供强大支持。此外，量子计算机执行的操作本质上是非确定性的，且据信经典计算机若要模拟量子系统，将需要指数级增长的时间和能量开销。因此，量子计算机在处理复杂问题方面具有潜在的巨大计算优势。",

      "Correspondence to: Denis Newman-Griffis,   \nAI Thinking: \nA framework for rethinking artificial intelligence in practice \n \n \nDenis Newman-Griffis \nInformation School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK \nResearch on Research Institute, London, UK  \n \nAbstract \nArtificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and \npractical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, \nand assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting \nunderstandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches \nare needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of \nAI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key \ndecisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The AI \nThinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: \nmotivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools \nand technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is \nused in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in \npractice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, \nincluding its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. \nAI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI \nuse, and to reshape the future of AI in practice. \n \nKeywords: Artificial intelligence; interdisciplinarity; AI applications; machine learning; AI \nThinking; Critical data studies \n1. Introduction \nArtificial intelligence has been positioned as a key driver of global change through a fourth \nindustrial revolution, and AI advances are actively transforming how we process, analyse, and \nlearn from information (1–3). The increasing relevance of AI across disciplines and sectors has \nled to a wide variety of views on the nature of this transformation, but it is most often envisioned \nthrough a technological lens: self-contained AI technologies that change (or replace) the \nprocesses we use to work with information.",
