    "answer": "The key goals in AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To achieve these goals, researchers use techniques such as search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also incorporates insights from psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and neuroscience.",

    "answer": "分布式量子计算与经典互联网计算的类比关系在于：正如经典互联网计算涉及通过经典互联网实现的分布式计算，分布式量子计算则是通过量子互联网实现的、在多个分布节点之间的量子计算。它利用分布在不同位置的量子计算机或量子处理单元，通过量子协议、非局域量子门和分布式量子应用等方式，在互联网规模的距离上协同完成复杂的量子计算任务，类似于经典系统中多台计算机通过网络协作进行分布式处理。",
