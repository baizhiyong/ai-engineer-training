    "question": "How did advancements post-2012 and 2017 contribute to the AI boom in the 2020s?",
    "answer": "Advancements after 2012 significantly contributed to the AI boom by enabling the use of graphics processing units to accelerate neural networks, which led to deep learning outperforming previous AI techniques. This progress laid the foundation for rapid developments in AI capabilities. Further acceleration occurred after 2017 with the introduction of the transformer architecture, which enhanced the performance of models, particularly in areas like natural language processing. These technological breakthroughs enabled the rise of advanced generative AI systems in the 2020s, driving widespread innovation and application across industries, ultimately fueling the ongoing AI boom.",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.

The quantum Internet will\nnot necessarily replace the (classical) Internet we know and\nuse today, at least not in the near future, but can complement\nthe current Internet. The quantum Internet aims to enable\nrobust quantum teleportation (or transmission) of qubits,1\nand entanglement among qubits,2 over long Internet-scale\ndistances, which are key to many of the quantum protocols\nincluding quantum key distribution, quantum voting, and\nothers, as well as for non-local control of quantum gates.\nThere have been efforts to build quantum computers,\nand it remains to see if any one paradigm becomes the\ndominant or best way of building such quantum comput-\ners. At the same time, even as researchers develop more\npowerful quantum computers (supporting more qubits for\noperations, and at lower error rates), there is an opportunity\nfor connecting multiple quantum computers from",

      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain",
      "atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\n\nHistory\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academi",

      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.

Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.

      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields). Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain",

    "question": "什么是量子计算机的核心特征及其相较于经典计算机的优势？",
    "answer": "量子计算机的核心特征在于其利用量子力学现象进行计算，基本单位是qubit（量子比特）。与经典比特只能处于0或1的确定状态不同，qubit可以处于0和1的叠加态，即同时表示两种状态的线性组合。此外，量子计算机还依赖于量子纠缠和量子干涉等特性，通过操控这些量子态，在测量时以概率方式获得结果，并利用干涉效应增强正确答案的概率。\n\n相较于经典计算机，量子计算机的优势体现在某些特定问题上具有指数级的计算速度提升。例如，它可以高效执行大数分解、搜索无序数据库以及模拟量子物理系统等任务，这些在经典计算机上需要极长时间才能完成。特别是，大规模量子计算机可能破解当前广泛使用的公钥加密体系，同时为科学研究提供强大的模拟工具。尽管目前硬件仍处于实验阶段，但已有实验证明量子设备在特定任务上实现了“量子优势”，即超越了现有经典计算机的能力。",

      "Correspondence to: Denis Newman-Griffis,   \nAI Thinking: \nA framework for rethinking artificial intelligence in practice \n \n \nDenis Newman-Griffis \nInformation School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK \nResearch on Research Institute, London, UK  \n \nAbstract \nArtificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and \npractical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, \nand assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting \nunderstandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches \nare needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of \nAI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key \ndecisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The AI \nThinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: \nmotivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools \nand technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is \nused in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in \npractice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, \nincluding its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. \nAI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI \nuse, and to reshape the future of AI in practice. \n \nKeywords: Artificial intelligence; interdisciplinarity; AI applications; machine learning; AI \nThinking; Critical data studies \n1. Introduction \nArtificial intelligence has been positioned as a key driver of global change through a fourth \nindustrial revolution, and AI advances are actively transforming how we process, analyse, and \nlearn from information (1–3). The increasing relevance of AI across disciplines and sectors has \nled to a wide variety of views on the nature of this transformation, but it is most often envisioned \nthrough a technological lens: self-contained AI technologies that change (or replace) the \nprocesses we use to work with information. However, the technology-centric perspective that \ndrives much of AI development and innovation fails to capture important aspects of the complex,",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom.
