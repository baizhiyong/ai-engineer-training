    "question": "How did advancements post-2012 and 2017 contribute to the AI boom in the 2020s?",
    "answer": "Advancements after 2012 significantly boosted AI development when graphics processing units began accelerating neural networks, enabling deep learning to surpass earlier AI methods. This progress intensified after 2017 with the introduction of the transformer architecture, which enhanced the capabilities of AI models, particularly in handling sequential data like language. These technological leaps laid the foundation for rapid advancements in generative AI during the 2020s, driving widespread innovation and marking the onset of the AI boom.",
    "contexts": [
      "Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems.

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include learning, reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields. Some companies, such as OpenAI, Google DeepMind and Meta, aim to create artificial general intelligence (AGI)—AI that can complete virtually any cognitive task at least as well as a human.\nArtificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism throughout its history, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winters. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom.",

    "question": "导致当前全球变暖的主要原因是什么？",
    "answer": "当前全球变暖的主要原因是人类活动，特别是自工业革命以来化石燃料（如煤炭、石油和天然气）的燃烧。这些活动与 deforestation 以及一些农业和工业实践共同导致大量温室气体排放。其中，二氧化碳是主要的温室气体，其浓度已比工业化前水平增加了约50%，达到数百万年来未曾见过的水平。这些气体在大气中捕获地球反射的热量，从而导致全球气温上升。",
    "contexts": [
      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.",

      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations.

Civil \nservants have complicated climate policy to expand bureaucracies, politicians to create rents. \nEnvironmentalists have exaggerated climate change to gain influence, other activists have \njoined the climate bandwagon. Opponents to climate policy have attacked the weaknesses in \nclimate research. The climate debate is convoluted and polarized as a result, and climate \npolicy complex. Climate policy should become easier and more rational as the Paris \nAgreement has shifted climate policy back towards national governments. Changing political \npriorities, austerity, and a maturing bureaucracy should lead to a more constructive climate \ndebate. \n \nKey words \nClimate policy; political economy \n \nJEL Classification \nF53, P16, Q54 \n \n1. Introduction \nThe best course of action for greenhouse gas emission reduction and adaptation to climate \nchange has been subject to debate for three decades. Much less attention has been paid to the \nnature and structure of the climate debate, and why certain actors adopt the position that they \ndo. In this paper, I use basic tools of political economy and the economics of organizations, \nas well as the philosophy of science and social psychology, to analyse the climate debate. \nEconomists have contributed large volumes of research on international environmental \nagreements and the architecture of international climate policy, and copious amounts of \npapers on the design of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and policy instrument \nchoice in the first- and second-best. Economists have been reluctant, however, to write much \nabout the climate debate itself and apply their tools of analysis to the question why \nparticipants in this debate behave the way they do. This paper makes a first attempt. \n\nClimate policy has moved slowly.",
      "Economists have been reluctant, however, to write much \nabout the climate debate itself and apply their tools of analysis to the question why \nparticipants in this debate behave the way they do. This paper makes a first attempt. \n\nClimate policy has moved slowly. This frustrates many, whether on the side of those who \nadvocate for rapid emission reduction or of the opinion that climate policy is a nonsense best \nforgotten. In either case, it helps to understand why the discussion is as it is, why people \nargue as they do, and why climate policy has neither gone away nor moved to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This paper makes a start in answering these questions. The method \nchosen is discursive rather than analytical, but readers who prefer analytics and econometrics \njust have to follow the references. \nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 revisits the case for climate policy. Section 3 \nsketches the optimal design of climate policy. These sections are kept short",

Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century. \nThere is widespread support for climate action worldwide, and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide. Fossil fuels can be phased out by stopping subsidising them, conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significa",
      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.",

    "answer": "量子计算机的核心特征在于其利用量子力学现象进行计算，特别是通过叠加态和纠缠态的特性，以及量子测量的非确定性结果。其基本信息单位是量子比特（qubit），与经典比特只能处于0或1不同，量子比特可以同时处于多个状态的线性组合中，从而在特定条件下并行处理大量可能性。\n\n相较于经典计算机，量子计算机的优势体现在某些特定问题上具有指数级的计算速度提升。例如，它可以高效破解当前广泛使用的公钥加密体系，并能更有效地模拟复杂量子系统。此外，量子计算机在执行某些专门任务时已展现出超越经典计算机的能力，这一里程碑被称为“量子优势”或“量子霸权”。尽管目前硬件仍处于实验阶段且应用受限，但其理论潜力远超经典计算模型。",

      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations. National governments have invested heavily in experimental research aimed at developing scalable qubits with longer coherence times and lower error rates. Example implementations include superconductors (which isolate an electrical current by eliminating electrical resistance) and ion traps (which confine a single atomic particle using electromagnetic fields).",

Opponents to climate policy have attacked the weaknesses in \nclimate research. The climate debate is convoluted and polarized as a result, and climate \npolicy complex. Climate policy should become easier and more rational as the Paris \nAgreement has shifted climate policy back towards national governments.

In this paper, I use basic tools of political economy and the economics of organizations, \nas well as the philosophy of science and social psychology, to analyse the climate debate. \nEconomists have contributed large volumes of research on international environmental \nagreements and the architecture of international climate policy, and copious amounts of \npapers on the design of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and policy instrument \nchoice in the first- and second-best.

      "Economists have been reluctant, however, to write much \nabout the climate debate itself and apply their tools of analysis to the question why \nparticipants in this debate behave the way they do. This paper makes a first attempt. \n\nClimate policy has moved slowly. This frustrates many, whether on the side of those who \nadvocate for rapid emission reduction or of the opinion that climate policy is a nonsense best \nforgotten. In either case, it helps to understand why the discussion is as it is, why people \nargue as they do, and why climate policy has neither gone away nor moved to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This paper makes a start in answering these questions. The method \nchosen is discursive rather than analytical, but readers who prefer analytics and econometrics \njust have to follow the references. \nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 revisits the case for climate policy. Section 3 \nsketches the optimal design of climate policy. These sections are kept short",
      "Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century. \nThere is widespread support for climate action worldwide, and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide. Fossil fuels can be phased out by stopping subsidising them, conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significa",
      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nMany climate change impacts have been observed in the first decades of the 21st century, with 2024 the warmest on record at +1.60 °C (2.88 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850.",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"\nVarious subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools.

A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, \nand assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting \nunderstandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches \nare needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of \nAI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key \ndecisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives. The AI \nThinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: \nmotivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools \nand technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is \nused in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in \npractice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, \nincluding its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. \nAI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI \nuse, and to reshape the future of AI in practice. \n \nKeywords: Artificial intelligence; interdisciplinarity; AI applications; machine learning; AI \nThinking; Critical data studies \n1.
