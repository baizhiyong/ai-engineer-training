    "answer": "Advancements post-2012, particularly the use of graphics processing units to accelerate neural networks and the superior performance of deep learning over previous AI techniques, significantly increased funding and interest in AI. This momentum was further amplified after 2017 with the introduction of the transformer architecture, which enabled more sophisticated models. These developments laid the foundation for rapid progress in generative AI during the 2020s, leading to the period known as the AI boom, characterized by the ability of AI to create and modify content at an unprecedented scale and quality.",

      "However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects amplify the probability of the desired measurement result. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform this amplification.\nQuantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications. Physically engineering high-quality qubits has proven to be challenging. If a physical qubit is not sufficiently isolated from its environment, it suffers from quantum decoherence, introducing noise into calculations.",

Researchers have claimed, and are widely believed to be correct, that certain quantum devices can outperform classical computers on narrowly defined tasks, a milestone referred to as quantum advantage or quantum supremacy. These tasks are not necessarily useful for real-world applications.\n\nHistory\nFor many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academi",
      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations."

Civil \nservants have complicated climate policy to expand bureaucracies, politicians to create rents. \nEnvironmentalists have exaggerated climate change to gain influence, other activists have \njoined the climate bandwagon. Opponents to climate policy have attacked the weaknesses in \nclimate research. The climate debate is convoluted and polarized as a result, and climate \npolicy complex. Climate policy should become easier and more rational as the Paris \nAgreement has shifted climate policy back towards national governments.",

In either case, it helps to understand why the discussion is as it is, why people \nargue as they do, and why climate policy has neither gone away nor moved to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This paper makes a start in answering these questions. The method \nchosen is discursive rather than analytical, but readers who prefer analytics and econometrics \njust have to follow the references. \nThe paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 revisits the case for climate policy. Section 3 \nsketches the optimal design of climate policy. These sections are kept short",

In this paper, I use basic tools of political economy and the economics of organizations, \nas well as the philosophy of science and social psychology, to analyse the climate debate. \nEconomists have contributed large volumes of research on international environmental \nagreements and the architecture of international climate policy, and copious amounts of \npapers on the design of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies and policy instrument \nchoice in the first- and second-best.",
      "Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.",
      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline."

      "Correspondence to: Denis Newman-Griffis,   \nAI Thinking: \nA framework for rethinking artificial intelligence in practice \n \n \nDenis Newman-Griffis \nInformation School, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK \nResearch on Research Institute, London, UK  \n \nAbstract \nArtificial intelligence is transforming the way we work with information across disciplines and \npractical contexts. A growing range of disciplines are now involved in studying, developing, \nand assessing the use of AI in practice, but these disciplines often employ conflicting \nunderstandings of what AI is and what is involved in its use. New, interdisciplinary approaches \nare needed to bridge competing conceptualisations of AI in practice and help shape the future of \nAI use. I propose a novel conceptual framework called AI Thinking, which models key \ndecisions and considerations involved in AI use across disciplinary perspectives.",
      "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of computational systems to perform tasks typically associated with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.\nHigh-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); virtual assistants (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., language models and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"",
      "The AI \nThinking model addresses five practice-based competencies involved in applying AI in context: \nmotivating AI use in information processes, formulating AI methods, assessing available tools \nand technologies, selecting appropriate data, and situating AI in the sociotechnical contexts it is \nused in. A hypothetical case study is provided to illustrate the application of AI Thinking in \npractice. This article situates AI Thinking in broader cross-disciplinary discourses of AI, \nincluding its connections to ongoing discussions around AI literacy and AI-driven innovation. \nAI Thinking can help to bridge divides between academic disciplines and diverse contexts of AI \nuse, and to reshape the future of AI in practice. \n \nKeywords: Artificial intelligence; interdisciplinarity; AI applications; machine learning; AI \nThinking; Critical data studies \n1. Introduction \nArtificial intelligence has been positioned as a key driver of global change through a fourth \nindustrial revolution, and AI advances are actively transforming how we process, analyse, and \nlearn from information (1–3).",
      "Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when graphics processing units started being used to accelerate neural networks and deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques. This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture. In the 2020s, an ongoing period of rapid progress in advanced generative AI became known as the AI boom. Generative AI's ability to create and modify content has led to several unintended consequences and harms, which has raised ethical concerns about AI's long-term effects and potential existential risks, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.\n\nGoals\nThe general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system t"
