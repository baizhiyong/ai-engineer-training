    "question": "什么是量子计算机的核心特征及其相较于经典计算机的优势？",
    "answer": "量子计算机的核心特征是利用量子力学现象，如叠加态和纠缠态，以及量子测量的非确定性结果，作为其计算过程的关键组成部分。其基本信息单位是量子比特（qubit），与经典比特只能处于0或1不同，量子比特可以同时处于两个状态的线性组合中，即量子叠加态。通过特定操作，量子计算机能够利用波的干涉效应增强期望测量结果的概率，这是量子算法设计的核心。\n\n相较于经典计算机，量子计算机在某些特定问题上被认为可以实现指数级的计算速度提升。例如，大规模量子计算机可能破解当前广泛使用的公钥加密系统，并显著加速物理系统的模拟。此外，虽然经典计算机原则上可以用经典机械装置以简单的倍增时间成本模拟，但据信经典计算机模拟量子计算机需要指数级更多的时间和能量。因此，量子计算机在处理特定复杂问题时具有潜在的巨大优势。",

      "A quantum computer is a (real or theoretical) computer that uses quantum mechanical phenomena in an essential way: it exploits superposed and entangled states, and the intrinsically non-deterministic outcomes of quantum measurements, as features of its computation. Quantum computers can be viewed as sampling from quantum systems that evolve in ways that may be described as operating on an enormous number of possibilities simultaneously, though still subject to strict computational constraints. By contrast, ordinary (\"classical\") computers operate according to deterministic rules. (A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations.",

Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline."

    "answer": "当前全球变暖的主要原因是人类活动，尤其是自工业革命以来化石燃料（如煤炭、石油和天然气）的燃烧。这些活动与砍伐森林以及某些农业和工业实践共同释放大量温室气体，其中二氧化碳是主要的驱动气体。这些气体在大气中积累，吸收地球表面辐射的热量，导致下层大气温度上升。",

      "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel (coal, oil and natural gas) burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline.",

Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss.

      "Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under 2 °C\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.8 °C (5.0 °F) by the end of the century. \nThere is widespread support for climate action worldwide, and most countries aim to stop emitting carbon dioxide.

    "question": "分布式量子计算与经典互联网计算的类比关系是什么？",
    "answer": "分布式量子计算与经典互联网计算的类比关系在于，前者是通过量子互联网实现的分布式量子计算，类似于后者通过经典互联网进行的经典分布式计算。量子互联网计算涉及在远距离分布节点之间使用量子信息执行计算任务，包括量子协议、量子云计算、可验证的盲化或私有计算、非局域量子门以及分布式量子应用等研究领域。这种类比突出了在大规模网络环境中协调和利用多台量子计算机的能力，就像经典互联网支持多台经典计算机协同工作一样。",

Loke, Member, IEEE\nAbstract—This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to distributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet,\nanalogous to (classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over the (classical) Internet. Relevant to\nquantum Internet computing would be areas of study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum information for\ncomputations, quantum cloud computing, delegated veriﬁable blind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.\nIndex Terms—quantum Internet computing, quantum Internet, distributed quantum computing, Internet computing, distributed\nsystems, Internet\n”This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.",
      "(A classical computer can, in principle, be replicated by a classical mechanical device, with only a simple multiple of time cost. On the other hand (it is believed), a quantum computer would require exponentially more time and energy to be simulated classically.) It is widely believed that a quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any classical computer. For example, a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used public-key cryptographic schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations. However, current hardware implementations of quantum computation are largely experimental and only suitable for specialized tasks.\nThe basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or \"quantum bit\"), serves the same function as the bit in ordinary or \"classical\" computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a linear combination of two states known as a quantum superposition. The result of measuring a qubit is one of the two states given by a probabilistic rule.",
      "There have been efforts to build quantum computers,\nand it remains to see if any one paradigm becomes the\ndominant or best way of building such quantum comput-\ners. At the same time, even as researchers develop more\npowerful quantum computers (supporting more qubits for\noperations, and at lower error rates), there is an opportunity\nfor connecting multiple quantum computers from differ-\nent sites to achieve much more complex quantum com-\nputations, i.e., inter-linking multiple quantum computers\non different sites to perform distributed computing with\na distributed system of quantum computers (or quantum\nprocessing units (QPUs) at different nodes), arriving at the\nnotion of distributed quantum computing, e.g., [3].\nWhile distributed quantum computing can involve mul-\ntiple QPUs next to each other or at the same site, with the\nquantum Internet, one can envision distributed quantum\n•\nSeng W.
