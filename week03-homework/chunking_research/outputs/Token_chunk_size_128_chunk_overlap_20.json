    "question": "什么是量子计算机的核心特征及其相较于经典计算机的优势？",
    "answer": "量子计算机的核心特征在于其利用量子力学现象进行计算，特别是叠加态和纠缠态，以及量子测量的非确定性结果。它能够以一种本质上的并行方式处理大量可能性，从而在某些特定任务上展现出超越经典计算机的能力。\n\n相较于经典计算机，量子计算机的优势体现在理论上可以指数级加速某些计算过程。例如，大规模量子计算机可能破解当前广泛使用的公钥加密体系，并显著提升物理模拟的效率。此外，已有实验表明，某些量子设备在特定定义的任务上超过了经典计算机的性能，这一里程碑被称为量子优势或量子霸权。然而，这些任务目前尚不具有广泛的实用价值，且现有硬件仍处于实验阶段，仅适用于专门问题。",
